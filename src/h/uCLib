/*
 * RISC OS uCLib (Micro C Library)
 *
 * purpouse: This is a small (micro) re-implementation of a generic
 *           C Library to use on RISC OS to build utils (transient)
 *           executables  using  the C  Programming  language  and,
 *           hopefully, C++ as well.
 *           Please note: This library is NOT a replacement for the
 *           Acorn/ROOL  SharedCLib (SCL)  or  the  ANSILib (ANSL).
 *           It is  intended for use  with applications that do not
 *           need the  entire  SCL or ANSL,  that  wish to  have no
 *           dependecies  on  the  SCL/ANSL and still use C for the
 *           source coding.
